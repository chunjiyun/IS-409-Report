                    <p>
                        Composite material is made from combining two or more
                        constituent materials with distinct physical or chemical
                        properties to create unique properties such as enhanced
                        strength and reduced weight compared to the the original
                        material alone. Generally, composite materials are the
                        product of a fiber material and a matrix material. Fiber
                        is the key to strength and stiffness and matrix material
                        acts as a bonding agent, holding the fiber together and
                        distributing loads across the composite. Common examples
                        of composite materials include carbon fiber, glass fiber
                        and aramid fiber.

                        Manufacturing Method
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Today, composite materials are not only prevalent in
                        large-scale industries but are also produced in
                        low-volume production and customized applications,
                        referred to as in-house manufacturing. There are
                        significant differences between industrial and in-house
                        manufacturing methods for producing composite parts. In
                        industrial contexts, composite manufacturing often
                        involves highly advanced technologies like automated
                        fiber placement as seen in Figure 2. This technique
                        employs robotic arms to precisely place narrow (0.3–3
                        cm) carbon fiber tapes onto a variety of surfaces,
                        enabling the efficient creation of complex shapes and
                        intricate corners with high precision.

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, in-house composite manufacturing is
                        often done in lower production volumes, various part
                        sizes and catered to the consumer needs. Instead of
                        advanced machinery like automated fiber placement,
                        in-house methods typically use a hand lay-up process on
                        molds. Today, NUS FSAE uses in-house composite
                        manufacturing to produce essential parts for their
                        racing car. This includes larger structures like the
                        front wing which is 1.3m x 0.5m x 0.06m (Figure 3) as
                        well as an electronics box which can be as small as 15cm
                        x 15cm x 15cm. My project scope is on the in-house
                        manufacturing method.

                        1.3 Three Major Methods for In-House Carbon Fiber Lay-Up
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        In in-house manufacturing, there are three major methods
                        used for carbon fiber lay-up. The first method is the
                        wet lay-up process as seen in Figure 4. This is done by
                        manually applying resin to the layers of dry fiber
                        reinforcement. This requires handling wet resin and
                        ensuring that the resin is evenly distributed with the
                        right amount.
                    </p>
                    <image-component
                        tag="image"
                        source="assets/wet-lay-up.png"
                        subtitle="Figure 4: Wet lay-up"></image-component>
                    <p>
                        The second method is prepreg lay-up in Figure 5.
                        Prepregs are carbon fiber sheets that are
                        pre-impregnated with a partially cured resin system.
                        Prepregs have a tacky texture and they can easily be cut
                        to fit the mold it is the easiest to handle out of the
                        three methods. Pre-pregs must be stored in refrigerated
                        conditions to prevent full curing until the lay-up is
                        completed.
                    </p>
                    <image-component

                        subtitle="Figure 5: Prepreg lay-up"></image-component>
                    <p>
                        The third and last method is resin transfer molding in
                        Figure 6. It uses a resin injection system to inject the
                        resin into a closed mold containing dry fibers.
                    </p>

                        subtitle="Figure 6: Resin transfer molding"></image-component>
                    <p>
                        While the three methods differ in the way resin is
                        applied to the fiber, the procedures used to process
                        these lay-ups are similar.

                        over other lay-up methods. Prepregs provide an excellent
                        strength-to-weight ratio which is ideal for high
                        performance applications where weight and mechanical
                        properties are critical. For example, the front wing
                        produced by NUS FSAE also uses prepregs for this reason.
                        Additionally, prepregs offer consistent quality of
                        composite parts because there is uniform fiber to resin
                        ratio and consistent ply thickness. They are also easy
                        to handle as it doesn’t require wet resins and this
                        reduces the curing time since the resin system is
                        already partially cured. To provide a clearer
                        understanding of the prepreg processing method, the
                        breakdown of the key steps involved is shown in Figure
                        7.

                        sealant tapes. Figure 9 shows a simplified diagram of

                    <h2>3. Challenges in Vacuum Bagging</h2>
                    <p>
                        Although the vacuum bagging process is essential for
                        in-house composite manufacturing methods, it poses four
                        major challenges related to skill dependency, time
                        intensive, cost and environmental impact.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The first challenge is that vacuum bagging is a highly
                        skill-dependent process. During the vacuuming phase, the
                        vacuum bag can easily form folds on the lay-up
                        especially for deep corners and complex shapes. These
                        folds are very critical as they can lead to inconsistent
                        vacuum pressure, resulting in bridging, voids, or
                        pinholes that can compromise the strength and quality of
                        the final composite part. Therefore, proper pleating
                        process is required when vacuuming the bag to ensure
                        that it’s fully conformed to the mold including
                        intricate corners. This increases the complexity of the
                        process and increases the demand for skilled labor,
                        making it a challenging method for less experienced
                        technicians to perform.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The second challenge is the time intensity of the
                        process. Because there are several steps involved in the
                        vacuum bagging process such as bagging, sealing and
                        monitoring the conformity of the vacuum bag, this
                        increases the overall production time. This reduces the
                        productivity and efficiency of producing composite
                        parts.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The third challenge is the high cost of vacuum bagging
                        materials. At NUS, for instance, each roll of vacuum
                        bagging film purchased every year costs $1562 SGD while
                        the sealant tape costs $5.47 SGD per roll. Figure 10
                        shows the specifications of the materials purchased in
                        NUS. Such expenses can add up quickly when the project
                        scale increases hence reducing material costs could
                        substantially lower production cost.

                        subtitle="Figure 10: Vacuum bagging film and sealant tape purchased by NUS">
                        <div id="table-2"></div>
                    </table-component>
                    <p>
                        The last challenge is the significant waste produced in
                        the process. The vacuum bag consists of several
                        auxiliary materials as seen in Figure 8 and 9. All four
                        materials are single-use materials leading to
                        substantial waste. For example, the vacuum bagging film
                        undergoes high plastic deformation hence cannot be
                        reused. As all the materials needed for vacuum bagging
                        are single-use, its environmental impact is great.
                        Finding sustainable alternatives or reusable options for
                        these materials would reduce waste and lessen the
                        environmental footprint of composite manufacturing.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        These challenges highlight the need for innovative
                        solutions to make vacuum bagging less skill-dependent,
                        more time and cost-efficient, and environmentally
                        friendly. Addressing these challenges will contribute to
                        a more sustainable approach to composite manufacturing.

                        reusable vacuum bag while simplifying the process to
                        reduce skill dependency, and accelerate the production
                        time while ensuring high-quality composite parts. Hence,

                    <p>
                        To establish the design specifications for reusable
                        vacuum bagging material, the conventional vacuum bagging
                        film, SL850 was used as the benchmark which can be seen
                        in Figure 11.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Hence, the reusable vacuum bagging material should have
                        the following design specifications:
                        <br />

                        1. <ins>Temperature</ins>: Withstand 180°C as that is
                        the maximum curing temperature in the oven/autoclave

                        Rubber’s maximum temperature tolerance is only 80°C
                        which means it will melt at curing temperature. Also,
                        rubber has high plastic deformation after stretching
                        making it unsuitable for use.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In contrast, silicone can withstand temperatures up to
                        315°C and its elongation can reach up to 1490% depending
                        on the thickness of the material.

                        According to the design specifications, the reusable
                        vacuum bagging film should be readily available in
                        Singapore to avoid dependency on limited suppliers in
                        in-house composite manufacturing.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In Singapore, there are two global distributors,
                        <strong>RS Components</strong> and
                        <strong>Misumi</strong>, that provide industrial and
                        electronic products. Figure 12 shows the three kinds of
                        silicone silicone sheets provided by RS Components. The
                        price of each silicone sheet is at least S$110.06 and
                        higher for the thicker option. This doesn’t meet the
                        design specification as the price is high and this goes
                        against the challenge that the project is trying to
                        solve. Most importantly, there are many more affordable
                        options on online shopping platforms like AliExpress.

                    <p>
                        There are many suppliers on AliExpress that sell various
                        thicknesses of silicone sheets at lower prices than RS
                        Components and Misumi. Using SL850 vacuum bagging film
                        as the benchmark, which has a thickness of 0.05mm, the
                        selected silicone sheets from Aliexperess were
                        thicknesses of 0.2mm, 0.5mm, 1mm, and 2mm. This range
                        ensures that because there are so many thickness
                        options, the measured elongations of the silicone will
                        help in data-driven decision in which silicone to use
                        for vacuum bagging. Figure 13 shows the purchased
                        silicone sheets on AliExpress and their prices.

                        Defining the “reusability” in the design specification
                        is done by comparing the cost per vacuum bag for both
                        SL850 film and silicone sheet. SL850 vacuum bagging film
                        has a length of 304m, width of 1.22m and a thickness of
                        0.0508mm and each roll costs S$1562. This means that for
                        a part that uses 1m x 1m sized film, one roll can be
                        used to do around 304 vacuum processes. Therefore, the
                        reusability of the reusable vacuum bag is defined by
                        whether the cost of one silicone sheet and reusing it
                        can outweigh the cost of 304 SL850 vacuum bags. For
                        SL850 vacuum bagging film, the cost per vacuum bag is:
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        1562 / 304 = S$5.14
                        <br />
                        For 0.2mm silicone sheet:
                        <br />
                        Length: 1m
                        <br />
                        Width: 0.5m
                        <br />
                        Thickness = 0.2mm
                        <br />
                        Price = S$11.31
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        S$11.31 / S$5.14 = 2.20
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        According to the calculation, reusing the silicone sheet
                        3 times outweighs the cost of making one vacuum bag
                        using SL850. If the silicone sheet can be reused more
                        than 3 times it is definitely cost-effective. This will
                        be tested with an actual composite mold as part of
                        future work.

                <h2>8. ASTM D412 Experiment with Silicone</h2>
                <p>
                    The significant limitation of the silicone purchased on
                    AliExpress is that although it’s cheap, the elongation data
                    is not provided. Therefore it is necessary to measure their
                    elongation rate and analyze their mechanical behavior to
                    assess their suitability for vacuum bagging applications.
                    ASTM D412 was used as a guideline to conduct this
                    assessment. ASTM D412 is a standard test method established
                    by ASTM International for determining the tensile properties
                    of rubber and elastomers which can be used for measuring key
                    mechanical properties such as tensile strength, elongation
                    at break, and stress-strain behavior under uniaxial tensile
                    loading.

                <p>
                    The objective of this experiment is to assess the
                    suitability of silicone for vacuum bagging by measuring its
                    elongation properties and identifying the appropriate
                    material thickness.

                <h3>8.2. Experiment Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>
                    The hypothesis of the experiment is as follows:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The silicone’s elongation will meet the design
                    specifications for reusable vacuum bagging material, while
                    thinner specimens will elongate more than thicker specimens
                    with less force required.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This hypothesis was established based on the known
                    mechanical properties of silicone elastomers, which are
                    characterized by high elasticity and the ability to undergo
                    significant elongation without permanent deformation.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Furthermore, principles of material mechanics suggest that
                    thinner specimens generally require less force to achieve
                    the same level of elongation compared to thicker ones due to
                    their reduced cross-sectional area and lower resistance to
                    tensile forces.

                    The CAD drawing was imported into a laser cutting machine to
                    produce an acrylic template of the dogbone specimen. Laser
                    cutting provided high precision, resulting in an exact
                    replica of the CAD design. Figure 15 shows the laser-cut

                <h3>8.4. Experiment Procedure</h3>
                <p>
                    An Instron 34TM-5 universal testing machine was used to
                    conduct the tensile tests on the silicone specimens. The
                    machine was configured with a grip-to-grip separation of 33
                    mm and a gauge length of 25 mm to accommodate the
                    standardized specimen dimensions. Grip pressure was
                    maintained at 100 psi (689 kPa) to ensure secure holding of
                    the specimens without causing premature failure or slippage
                    during testing.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The tests were performed at the speed of 500 ± 50 mm/min,
                    adhering to the guidelines specified in ASTM D412. Each
                    silicone specimen was elongated until breakage occurred to
                    determine the material's ultimate elongation and tensile
                    strength. See Figure 17 for a video footage of the testing
                    for one of the specimens. Figure 17: Video footage of a

                <h3>8.5. Experiment Results and Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    During the experiment, the testing machine collected
                    multiple displacement readings for the same force value,
                    resulting in a one-to-many relationship between force and
                    displacement data points. For example, at a force of 0.001
                    kN, several displacement measurements were recorded. When
                    plotted, this data produced a graph (see Figure X) that made
                    it difficult to determine the elongation at specific force
                    levels.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To resolve this issue, data cleaning was performed to
                    establish a one-to-one mapping between force and
                    displacement. The following steps were taken:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    1. <ins>Identify the Failure Point</ins>: The point at which
                    each specimen failed was identified in the dataset.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. <ins>Sort Force Data</ins>: Force values were sorted in
                    ascending order from 0 N up to the failure point for each
                    specimen.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3. <ins>Generate New Force Dataset</ins>: A new set of force
                    values was created, starting from 0 N with increments of
                    0.0001 kN.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    4. <ins>Average Displacement Values</ins>: For each force
                    value in the new dataset, the average displacement was
                    calculated from the multiple displacement readings
                    corresponding to that force. This ensured a one-to-one
                    correspondence between force and displacement.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    5. <ins>Use Raw Data Beyond Failure Point</ins>: From the
                    failure point onwards, the raw force and displacement data
                    were retained without modification.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    6. <ins>Create Scatter Plot</ins>: A scatter plot was
                    generated using the cleaned force and displacement data,
                    resulting in a clearer representation of the material's
                    behavior (see Figure X).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This data cleaning process was repeated for specimens with
                    thicknesses of 0.2 mm, 0.5 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm to ensure
                    consistency and accuracy across all tests.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Figure 18 and 19 shows the compiled scatter plot The
                    experiment showed that 0.5mm thickness elongates the most
                    with the least force required to stretch to that point. This
                    can be seen by the orange line that stretches the furthest
                    in Figure 18. 2mm (purple) and 1.5mm both broke at similar
                    elongation. However, 2mm needed (green) needed the greatest
                    force to elongate.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Figure 18 shows a clear trend where thicker specimens
                    require more force to reach similar displacement values. The
                    2.0 mm specimen, represented in purple, shows the highest
                    force values for a given displacement, followed by the 1.0
                    mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.2 mm specimens. Thinner specimens (0.2 mm)
                    reach higher displacements at much lower forces, indicating
                    greater flexibility but lower strength compared to thicker
                    specimens.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    According to Figure 19, 0.5 mm specimen has the highest
                    elongation at break (301 mm) and percentage elongation
                    (1200%), indicating it can stretch the most before breaking.
                    This suggests an optimal balance of flexibility and strength
                    for this thickness. The 0.2 mm specimen shows significant
                    elongation (167 mm, 668%), but due to its low force
                    threshold (0.0066 kN), it is less resistant to higher
                    forces, making it weaker than the thicker specimens. The 1.0
                    mm and 2.0 mm specimens exhibit reduced elongation
                    percentages (760% and 716%, respectively) but can withstand
                    higher forces (0.0324 kN and 0.06055 kN, respectively),
                    indicating greater strength than 0.2mm.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Three 0.2mm specimens slipped off from the machine grip
                    hence they are not included in the graph.
