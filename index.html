                    <p>
                        Composite material is made from combining two or more
                        constituent materials with distinct physical or chemical
                        properties to create unique properties such as enhanced
                        strength and reduced weight compared to the the original
                        material alone. Generally, composite materials are the
                        product of a fiber material and a matrix material. Fiber
                        is the key to strength and stiffness and matrix material
                        acts as a bonding agent, holding the fiber together and
                        distributing loads across the composite. Common examples
                        of composite materials include carbon fiber, glass fiber
                        and aramid fiber.

                        Manufacturing Method
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Today, composite materials are not only prevalent in
                        large-scale industries but are also produced in
                        low-volume production and customized applications,
                        referred to as in-house manufacturing. There are
                        significant differences between industrial and in-house
                        manufacturing methods for producing composite parts. In
                        industrial contexts, composite manufacturing often
                        involves highly advanced technologies like automated
                        fiber placement as seen in Figure 2. This technique
                        employs robotic arms to precisely place narrow (0.3–3
                        cm) carbon fiber tapes onto a variety of surfaces,
                        enabling the efficient creation of complex shapes and
                        intricate corners with high precision.

                    <p>
                        On the other hand, in-house composite manufacturing is
                        often done in lower production volumes, various part
                        sizes and catered to the consumer needs. Instead of
                        advanced machinery like automated fiber placement,
                        in-house methods typically use a hand lay-up process on
                        molds. Today, NUS FSAE uses in-house composite
                        manufacturing to produce essential parts for their
                        racing car. This includes larger structures like the
                        front wing which is 1.3m x 0.5m x 0.06m (Figure 3) as
                        well as an electronics box which can be as small as 15cm
                        x 15cm x 15cm. My project scope is on the in-house
                        manufacturing method.

                        1.3 Three Major Methods for In-House Carbon Fiber Lay-Up
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        In in-house manufacturing, there are three major methods
                        used for carbon fiber lay-up. The first method is the
                        wet lay-up process as seen in Figure 4. This is done by
                        manually applying resin to the layers of dry fiber
                        reinforcement. This requires handling wet resin and
                        ensuring that the resin is evenly distributed with the
                        right amount.
                    </p>
                    <image-component
                        tag="image"
                        source="assets/wet-lay-up.png"
                        subtitle="Figure 4: Wet lay-up"></image-component>
                    <p>
                        The second method is prepreg lay-up in Figure 5.
                        Prepregs are carbon fiber sheets that are
                        pre-impregnated with a partially cured resin system.
                        Prepregs have a tacky texture and they can easily be cut
                        to fit the mold it is the easiest to handle out of the
                        three methods. Pre-pregs must be stored in refrigerated
                        conditions to prevent full curing until the lay-up is
                        completed.
                    </p>
                    <image-component

                        subtitle="Figure 5: Prepreg lay-up"></image-component>
                    <p>
                        The third and last method is resin transfer molding in
                        Figure 6. It uses a resin injection system to inject the
                        resin into a closed mold containing dry fibers.
                    </p>

                        subtitle="Figure 6: Resin transfer molding"></image-component>
                    <p>
                        While the three methods differ in the way resin is
                        applied to the fiber, the procedures used to process
                        these lay-ups are similar.

                        over other lay-up methods. Prepregs provide an excellent
                        strength-to-weight ratio which is ideal for high
                        performance applications where weight and mechanical
                        properties are critical. For example, the front wing
                        produced by NUS FSAE also uses prepregs for this reason.
                        Additionally, prepregs offer consistent quality of
                        composite parts because there is uniform fiber to resin
                        ratio and consistent ply thickness. They are also easy
                        to handle as it doesn’t require wet resins and this
                        reduces the curing time since the resin system is
                        already partially cured. To provide a clearer
                        understanding of the prepreg processing method, the
                        breakdown of the key steps involved is shown in Figure
                        7.

                        steps in Figure 7, Figure 8 illustrates a real-life
                        example of a prepreg lay-up. In this assembly, prepreg
                        lay-up is positioned between the vacuum bagging film and
                        a flat plate at the base with the edges sealed using
                        sealant tapes. Figure 9 shows a simplified diagram of
                        this assembly.

                    <h2>3. Challenges in Vacuum Bagging</h2>
                    <p>
                        Although the vacuum bagging process is essential for
                        in-house composite manufacturing methods, it poses four
                        major challenges related to skill dependency, time
                        intensive, cost and environmental impact.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The first challenge is that vacuum bagging is a highly
                        skill-dependent process. During the vacuuming phase, the
                        vacuum bag can easily form folds on the lay-up
                        especially for deep corners and complex shapes. These
                        folds are very critical as they can lead to inconsistent
                        vacuum pressure, resulting in bridging, voids, or
                        pinholes that can compromise the strength and quality of
                        the final composite part. Therefore, proper pleating
                        process is required when vacuuming the bag to ensure
                        that it’s fully conformed to the mold including
                        intricate corners. This increases the complexity of the
                        process and increases the demand for skilled labor,
                        making it a challenging method for less experienced
                        technicians to perform.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The second challenge is the time intensity of the
                        process. Because there are several steps involved in the
                        vacuum bagging process such as bagging, sealing and
                        monitoring the conformity of the vacuum bag, this
                        increases the overall production time. This reduces the
                        productivity and efficiency of producing composite
                        parts.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The third challenge is the high cost of vacuum bagging
                        materials. At NUS, for instance, each roll of vacuum
                        bagging film purchased every year costs $1562 SGD while
                        the sealant tape costs $5.47 SGD per roll. Figure 10
                        shows the specifications of the materials purchased in
                        NUS. Such expenses can add up quickly when the project
                        scale increases hence reducing material costs could
                        substantially lower production cost.
